# 5 Jokes About Overhyping AI

1. They said AI would replace my job, so I taught it to make coffee. Now it runs a hugely successful TikTok about latte art while I keep getting promoted for actually doing the work.

2. The hype said AI would make everything smarter. Turns out my toaster only got smarter at asking for a software update â€” every time it burns the toast it blames "legacy carbs."

3. Investors poured money into an AI that "understands human emotion." It nodded thoughtfully at meetings, charged premium subscription fees, and ghosted everyone when the project went dark.

4. I asked an AI for life advice and it replied, "According to my analysis, you should buy Bitcoin and start a podcast." I asked it for dinner ideas and it suggested starting a podcast about Bitcoin instead.

5. The company branded its chatbot as "groundbreaking" and "revolutionary." It was mainly used to forward office memes and pretend to be in meetings. Revolution achieved.
