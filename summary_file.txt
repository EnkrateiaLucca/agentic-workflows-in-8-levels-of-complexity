Embeddings are vector representations that capture semantic meaning across text, images, and audio, enabling tasks like search, clustering, recommendation, and cross-modal retrieval. They underpin techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation and serve as a bridge between raw data and machine reasoning, with increasingly specialized models driving advances in AI search, personalization, and knowledge navigation.
